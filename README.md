# Notion Calendar Helper

A small utility web app to streamline creating my Notion calendar

## Note

As a workaround for the Notion API not having CORS headers, Chrome can be launched with reduced security with the following command (on MacOS):
```
open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_sess_1" --disable-web-security
```
